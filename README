# Transfer Learning in Python

## Overview

This project applies **Transfer Learning** to a **Deep Learning** neural network using **Python** in the **Google Colab** environment.

In this example, we use a **cats vs. dogs** dataset to demonstrate Transfer Learning techniques. The project will guide you through how to implement Transfer Learning using pre-trained models (e.g., **VGG16**) and how you can adapt them to your own dataset.

> **Note:** You can replace the **cats and dogs** dataset with any other dataset, such as photos of yourself, friends, family, or pets.

## Project Structure

- **Dataset:** [Cats vs. Dogs Dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/cats_vs_dogs)
- **Dataset for Download:** [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765)
- **Google Colab Notebook:** [Transfer Learning in Python](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kylemath/ml4a-guides/blob/master/notebooks/transfer-learning.ipynb)

### Custom Dataset Option

If you prefer to use a custom dataset, feel free to replace the cats and dogs dataset with your own images, whether it's **photos of yourself**, **family**, **friends**, or **pets**. This flexibility allows you to apply Transfer Learning to any classification problem of your choice.

You can also use the dataset created in a **previous project** as input for this one.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Google Colab** (used for running code in the cloud)
- **Python 3.x**
- **TensorFlow** (for machine learning)
- **Keras** (for neural network creation)

### Setting Up

1. **Download the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset from [Microsoft's official site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54765).
   - Extract it and upload to **Google Colab**.

2. **Import Libraries**:
   The notebook will guide you through importing necessary libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, and others.

### Example of Code Flow

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
